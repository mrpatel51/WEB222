	<p>Responsive design is about making website look good on every platform like mobile device, desktops, or tablets by using HTML and CSS to resize it accordingly. In short, it’s a design approach that can adjusts smoothly on various screen sizes. </p>
	<p>There are so many benefits to web technologies by using responsive design. Nowadays, most of the users access website through their mobile phones. So, by responsive design companies can make one website for all platforms and can save the extra cost of developing a whole new platform specific website. Companies can get user friendly websites as their visitors don’t have to zoom in or zoom out to do operations, and it loads more faster than specific platform-based websites. </p>
	<p>The web app is basically an interactive computer program built with web technologies like HTML, CSS, JS. So, to build a web app you should have the knowledge of those. In my opinion, visual studio is good for building web apps. You should always focus on user when planning the design. When you develop it, you should often test for bugs and errors. Security should be your biggest concern when building a web app, it should always protect its user’s data. </p>
	<p>By completing WEB222 course, I learned about most important web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I think that it is a fun course to learn and it not very difficult too, like other coding languages. The professor is very good and always responds to any queries you have. I enjoyed doing assignments in this course and I will look forward to learning more concepts in WEB322 in next semester. </p>
